# FTP Streaming Optimization

## The Insight

Your FTP server is actually FAST - it can stream 3D movies! The previous approach was **fighting against the server** with overly aggressive timeouts and tiny buffers.

## New Streaming-Optimized Approach

### What Changed:
- ‚úÖ **256MB buffer** (was 8MB) - much better for sustained transfers
- ‚úÖ **No timeout** (was 2 minutes) - let streams flow naturally
- ‚úÖ **Keep partial files** (was deleting) - enable FTP resume
- ‚úÖ **5 minute stall detection** (was 90 seconds) - allow for variations
- ‚úÖ **Remove rate limiting** - was artificially slowing down transfers

## What "Smart Continuation" Actually Means

### ‚úÖ **WORKS: Between Workflow Runs**
The state tracking system works PERFECTLY for resuming **between different workflow runs**:

```
Run 1:
  ‚ùå File A - failed (marked in state)
  ‚úÖ File B - success (marked in state)
  ‚è±Ô∏è Workflow times out

Run 2:
  ‚è≠Ô∏è File A - retry (was marked failed)
  ‚è≠Ô∏è File B - skip (already completed)
  ‚úÖ File C - success
  ‚è±Ô∏è Workflow times out

Run 3:
  ‚è≠Ô∏è File A - retry again
  ‚è≠Ô∏è File B - skip (already completed)
  ‚è≠Ô∏è File C - skip (already completed)
  ...continues...
```

This is the **primary value** of smart continuation - the workflow can run many times and never re-process successfully uploaded files.

### ‚úÖ **NOW WORKS: Within a Single Download**
FTP protocol DOES support resume via the REST command:

```
Attempt 1: Download 15GB ‚Üí stalls ‚Üí kill (partial file kept)
Attempt 2: Resume from 15GB ‚Üí 30GB ‚Üí complete!
```

**How:**
- rclone detects partial files
- Uses FTP REST command to resume
- Your streaming servers DO support this
- Much more efficient for large files!

## Current Strategy

### What We're Doing Now:

1. **Streaming-Optimized Downloads**
   - Keep partial files for resume
   - Use FTP REST command to continue
   - Large 256MB buffer for sustained transfer
   - No artificial timeout (let it stream!)
   - 5 minute stall detection (allow variations)

2. **Smart Retries**
   - 5 attempts max per file
   - 60 second wait between attempts
   - Each retry resumes from last position
   - If all 5 fail ‚Üí mark as FAILED in state

3. **State Persistence**
   - Failed files tracked in `upload_state.json`
   - Next workflow run retries failed files
   - Completed files never retried
   - Partial files kept for resume

4. **Streaming-Friendly rclone Settings**
   ```
   --buffer-size 256M        # LARGE buffer for streaming
   --timeout 0               # No timeout - let it flow!
   --contimeout 300s         # 5min initial connection
   --no-traverse             # Direct copy, no listing
   --streaming-upload-cutoff 0  # Stream everything
   --use-mmap                # Memory-mapped I/O
   ```

## The Real Solution

With streaming-optimized settings for your fast FTP servers:

### Expected Performance
- **Small files (< 5GB)**: Complete in 1-2 attempts
- **Medium files (5-15GB)**: Complete in 1-3 attempts with resume
- **Large files (15-50GB)**: May need 2-5 attempts, resuming each time
- Each workflow run = 6 hours max = can process many files!

### Example Timeline (Much Better!)
```
Run 1:
  ‚úÖ 15 files completed (resumed partial ones)
  ‚ùå 2 large files failed but have 20GB downloaded
  
Run 2:
  ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip 15 completed
  üîÑ Resume 2 large files from 20GB ‚Üí ‚úÖ Complete!
  ‚úÖ 12 new files completed

Run 3:
  ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip 29 completed
  ‚úÖ 10 more files completed
  ...continues efficiently...
```

### When Files Fail Repeatedly (3+ times)
Files that fail 3 times in a row across workflow runs are marked as "exceeded retry limit" and skipped. This prevents infinite loops on corrupted files.

## What You Can Do

### Option 1: Let It Run (Recommended)
- Schedule workflow to run every 2 hours
- Let it process files gradually
- Check back weekly to see progress
- Small/medium files will complete
- Large files may eventually succeed or fail permanently

### Option 2: Monitor and Adjust
Your FTP servers are actually good for streaming:
- ‚úÖ Fast speeds (45+ MB/s capable)
- ‚úÖ Resume support (FTP REST)
- ‚úÖ Reliable enough for movie streaming

The new settings should work much better! Monitor the runs and adjust if needed.

### Option 3: Download Locally First
If you have a good internet connection:
1. Download files to your PC using rclone
2. Upload to Google Photos from your PC
3. Much more reliable than GitHub Actions ‚Üí FTP ‚Üí Google Photos

```bash
# On your PC
rclone copy 3DFF: ./local_movies --progress
# Then upload to Google Photos using gpmc locally
```

## FTP Resume - It Actually Works!

**Technical Reality:**
- FTP protocol: Has REST command for resume
- Your servers: Support it (they stream movies!)
- rclone FTP: DOES support resume automatically
- Strategy: Keep partial files, rclone detects and resumes

**What happens now:**
1. Download starts: 0GB ‚Üí 15GB ‚Üí connection issue
2. Partial file kept on disk: 15GB
3. Next attempt: rclone sees 15GB file
4. rclone sends FTP REST command: "start from 15GB"  
5. Transfer resumes: 15GB ‚Üí 30GB ‚Üí done!

The previous approach was **deleting** partial files, preventing resume!

## Bottom Line

‚úÖ **State tracking works GREAT** - no re-uploading completed files
‚ùå **FTP resume doesn't work** - each attempt starts fresh
üêå **Your FTP is very slow** - this is the real problem
‚è±Ô∏è **Time will help** - run workflow regularly, files will gradually complete
üìä **Track progress** - download state file to see what's completed

The "smart continuation" is working as designed for what's actually possible with your FTP setup. The workflow will keep trying, tracking progress, and eventually transfer everything it can.
