"""
EXPERIMENTAL: Parallel download and upload to reduce storage time.
Downloads file while simultaneously starting upload when file is complete.
This doesn't reduce peak storage but reduces total time file sits on disk.
"""

import os
import sys
import threading
import time
from pathlib import Path

# This is a PROOF OF CONCEPT - showing how parallel processing could work
# But it doesn't solve the storage problem since we still need the full file

def download_file_async(remote_path, local_path, completion_event):
    """Download file in background thread"""
    print(f"üì• Starting download: {remote_path}")
    # ... download code here ...
    # When complete:
    completion_event.set()
    print(f"‚úÖ Download complete")

def upload_when_ready(local_path, auth_data, completion_event):
    """Wait for download, then upload"""
    print(f"‚è≥ Waiting for download to complete...")
    completion_event.wait()  # Wait for download
    
    if local_path.exists():
        print(f"üì§ Starting upload immediately")
        # ... upload code here ...
        print(f"‚úÖ Upload complete")
        
        # Delete immediately
        os.remove(local_path)
        print(f"üóëÔ∏è Deleted file")

# Example usage:
# completion_event = threading.Event()
# download_thread = threading.Thread(target=download_file_async, args=(...))
# upload_thread = threading.Thread(target=upload_when_ready, args=(...))
# download_thread.start()
# upload_thread.start()
# upload_thread.join()  # Wait for upload to finish

"""
CONCLUSION: This doesn't help because:
- Still need full 30GB on disk at once
- Just reduces time before upload starts by a few seconds
- Doesn't solve GitHub Actions 14GB limit
